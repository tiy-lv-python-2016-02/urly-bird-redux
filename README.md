## Description

Enhance the urly-bird system with a few extra features.

## Normal Mode
* Make it so your users can add a profile picture which is uploaded to the server.
* Use the session to store the last 5 bookmarks seen or used.
* Using template extensions display the titles of the bookmarks with links on each page
* Create a command that creates a csv report with the top 20 bookmarks in the past 2 days

## Hard Mode
* Look at [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) and change your image hosting over to use their system
* Using sessions store the tags and counts of links used by the user then add a section on the personal page of the user to allow them to see the top 10 links from their most used favorites from a given browser session.
* Create a command that makes a csv of the top performing users, how many links, tags, and views each got.  Additionally, use the argument method override in the command to allow a `dry_run` option which output the data instead of creating a report.
